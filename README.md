# Vehicle Diagnostics & Automation Tool 🚗🔧

A Python-based command-line tool simulating remote vehicle diagnostics, fault categorization, and automated ticket creation, inspired by real-world telematics workflows.

## 🔍 Overview

This tool mimics how service engineers or automated systems might identify issues in connected vehicle systems (e.g., powertrain, sensors, telematics) and escalate faults through an incident management platform like ServiceNow.

## 📦 Features

- 🔄 Simulated fault detection per system (Powertrain, Connectivity, Sensors)
- 🧠 Mock diagnostics engine using random fault injection
- 📝 ServiceNow-style ticket generation and logging
- 📊 JSON-based ticket summaries
- 🛠 Modular and extendable architecture

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Internet connection (if using real API version)
- ServiceNow (if using ServiceNow version)
